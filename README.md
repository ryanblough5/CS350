# CS350
1) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was a culmination of all of our work in this course, utilizing the Raspberry Pi and the circuit that I have worked on the last eight weeks, I was able to successfully create and code the circuit to act as a thermostat.

2) What did you do particularly well?

I feel that I did best with creating the circuit, I got more and more comfortable with the coding as the course progressed. But, I was alsways able to complete the circuit without much trouble.

3) Where could you improve?

As I mentioned, I feel like that I could always learn to code more effectively, I got more comfortable as time passed but I feel like there is room to grow there.

4) What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I found using the Raspberry Pi was a good way to program things and allow things (like embedded systems) to work well, I didn't realize how prevelant things like the Raspberry Pi were until this course.

5) What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

I think that the skills that I learned to utilize the Raspberry Pi are very useful, and can think of multiple uses to make mundane day-to-day tasks a little easier.

6) How did you make this project, readable, and adaptable?

One thing that I still don't quite know how to is to transfer the code from the Raspberry Pi to the desktop to make it understandable. I figured out how to use the scp command to transfer the code to my desktop, but it didn't look quite right. So, I used a Python IDE to edit it and make it look more presentable before submitting it.
